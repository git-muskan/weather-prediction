# weather-prediction
Machine Learning Project for Weather Prediction implemented using Random Forest algorithm

The Weather Forecasting Project utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to predict weather conditions for specific days. With this project, users can forecast temperatures, as well as look up historical weather data.

## Features
Weather Forecasting: Predict temperature conditions for any given day using a trained Random Forest model.

Date Lookup: Retrieve historical weather data for a specified date.

User Interface: Interactive web application built with Streamlit for easy date input and weather prediction.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x
Libraries:
  Pandas for data manipulation
  NumPy for numerical operations
  Scikit-learn for machine learning and model implementation
  Streamlit for building the interactive web application
  Joblib for saving and loading the model
